# Bounce Game (Abandoned)

This project is an abandoned game inspired by the classic mobile game called Bounce. It aims to recreate the simple and addictive gameplay of the original game.

# Status

Project Abandoned. My knowledge of creating logic in transitioning between scenes is still lacking. I'll create a newer simpler project. I'll probably return to this project at a later date once I think I'm good enough.

## Description

The Bounce game features a ball that bounces off walls and obstacles, controlled by the player. The objective is to navigate the ball through different stages, avoiding obstacles and reaching the goal.

### Features

- Simple ball physics and controls
- Two stages implemented out of the planned 5 or 7 stages
- Basic collision detection
- Stage progression from the menu to the gameplay scene

## Project Status

The development of this game is currently ongoing. But at a slow pace to avoid burnout.

## Future Improvements

The following improvements are planned for future development:

- Implement sound effects for interactions and game events
- Complete the remaining stages to provide a full game experience
- Refine gameplay mechanics and add power-ups or additional features

## Development Environment

The game is developed using the Unity game engine and written in C#. It requires Unity version 2021.3.18f1 or higher.

## How to Play
