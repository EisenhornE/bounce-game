# Bounce Game (Abandoned)

This project is an abandoned game inspired by the classic mobile game called Bounce. It aims to recreate the simple and addictive gameplay of the original gam

## Description

The Bounce game features a ball that bounces off walls and obstacles, controlled by the player. The objective is to navigate the ball through different stages, avoiding obstacles and reaching the goal.

### Features

- Simple ball physics and controls
- Two stages implemented out of the planned 5 or 7 stages
- Basic collision detection
- Stage progression from the menu to the gameplay scene

## Project Status

Project Abandoned. My knowledge of creating logic in transitioning between scenes is still lacking. I'll create a newer simpler project. Also, my lack of knowledge of using Git practically ruined this project. A git revert destroyed stages that took some time to fix and I'm already tired of this project anyway. I'll probably return to this project at a later date once I think I'm good enough,
